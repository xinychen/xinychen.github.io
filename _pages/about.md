I am currently a **master student** in the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering at **Sun Yat-Sen University**. My research interests are machine learning, mobility computing, and urban traffic data analytics. Recently, I focused on spatiotemporal (multivariate/multidimensional) time series imputation and prediction, and the related papers have been published in the top journal - *Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies*.

Research Interests
======
- **Machine learning**: Bayesian matrix and tensor factorization; variational auto-encoder (VAE); generative adversarial network (GAN).
- **Urban traffic data analytics**: Missing data imputation; spatio-temporal time series prediction; anomaly detection; individual trip patterns discovery.
