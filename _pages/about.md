I am currently a research assistant supervised by [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/). I received my Master degree in Transportation Information Engineering & Control from Sun Yat-Sen University, China in 2019. My research interests include Machine Learning and Spatiotemporal Data Modeling. Recently, I focused on spatiotemporal (multivariate/multidimensional) time series imputation and prediction, and the related papers have been published in the top journal - *Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies*.

- [**transdim**](https://github.com/xinychen/transdim): Machine learning for transportation data imputation and prediction. [[100+ stars](https://github.com/xinychen/transdim/stargazers)]

> In the transdim (transportation data imputation) project, we build machine learning models to help address some of the toughest challenges of spatiotemporal data modeling - from missing data imputation to time series prediction. The strategic aim of this project is creating accurate and efficient solutions for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation and prediction tasks.
