    <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=MmujBClawFo">
      Attention: Self-expression is all you need</a> on OpenReview.
      This work has tried to connect transformers with the prior art, a very good attempt!</p>
  <li> <p> February 12: Our papers have received 1,000 citations on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mCrW04wAAAAJ&hl">Google Scholar</a>. Many thanks to the research community!</p>
