<b>Personal Update:</b><br> I am now working on some open-source research projects, including <a href="https://github.com/xinychen/transdim">transdim</a> (Machine learning for <b>trans</b>portation <b>d</b>ata <b>im</b>putation and prediction) and <a href="https://github.com/xinychen/tracebase">tracebase</a> (Multivariate time series forecasting on high-dimensional and sparse Uber movement speed data). If you are interested, welcome to take a look and give me feedback!

<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr> <br>
I am Xinyu Chen (陈新宇), a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/">
  Polytechnique Montreal</a> affiliated with <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/en/">
    University of Montreal</a> in Canada. I am currently working on developing some data-driven machine learning methods (e.g., matrix/tensor methods) and autoregressive time series methods for modeling various spatiotemporal data. These data include human mobility, traffic flow, fluid flow, climate/weather data, and energy consumption data. 
          The specific scientific problems are 1) estimating and forecasting missing values of spatiotemporal data in real-world scenarios, 2) discovering dynamic patterns from spatiotemporal data (e.g., human mobility and climate data), and 3) generating high-resolution output from the low-resolution input data according to the spatiotemporal domain knowledge (e.g., speed field reconstruction and high-resolution climate variables generation). 
          My Ph.D. research project is "Spatiotemporal Traffic Data Imputation and Forecasting with Low-Rank Models".<br>
          <br>
          I have strong background knowledge in data science and matrix/tensor computations. I like mathematics and computer science related stuff.
        My research interests include (but are not limited to) machine learning, spatiotemporal data modeling, and intelligent transportation systems.
        My research papers have been cited more than 600 times on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mCrW04wAAAAJ&hl">Google Scholar</a>, and they have been published in some top-tier scientific journals, including (as the first author)<br>
<br>
  <span>&#9675;</span> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=34">IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</a> (<b>TPAMI</b>, 1 paper) (IF: 24.314)<br>
  <span>&#9675;</span> <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/transportation-research-part-c-emerging-technologies">Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</a> (5 papers)<br>
  <span>&#9675;</span> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6979">IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</a> (1 paper)<br>
<br>
These papers include one ESI hot paper (<span>&#128293;</span>) and two ESI highly cited papers (<span>&#127942;</span>).
My research philosophy comes from an ancient Chinese philosopher and writer Laozi (老子), who stated "大道至简". I am a strong advocate of open-source and reproducible research. 
          To contribute more ideas to the research community, I am trying to make the datasets and Python codes of our research publicly available on GitHub. 
          I am now leading some innovative open-source projects on <a href = "https://github.com/xinychen">
  GitHub</a> (with 400+ followers), and they have accumulated more than 3,000 stars. Two most popular GitHub repositories are <a href="https://github.com/xinychen/transdim">transdim</a> (providing machine learning algorithms for transportation data imputation and prediction, 900+ stars) and <a href="https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing">aswesome-latex-drawing</a> (providing academic drawing examples in LaTeX, 1,000+ stars).
          I also enjoy writing some blog posts on <a href="https://medium.com/@xinyu.chen">Medium</a> about our research and try to make our research be more accessible.

<br>
<br>
Fortunately, I have received several awards, including <a href="https://ivado.ca/en/scholarships-and-grants/phd-excellence-scholarships/">IVADO PhD Excellence Scholarship</a> (by Institute for Data Valorisation (IVADO)) and <a href="https://www.cirrelt.ca/">CIRRELT PhD Excellence Scholarship</a> (by Interuniversity Research Centre on Enterprise Networks, Logistics and Transportation (CIRRELT)). I would like to thank IVADO and CIRRELT for funding my Ph.D. research.
