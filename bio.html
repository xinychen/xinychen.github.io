<h1>Biography</h1>
<hr> <br>
Nicolas Loizou is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute and the Université de Montréal. He completed his Ph.D. studies in Optimization and Operational Research at the University of Edinburgh, School of Mathematics, in 2019. Prior to that, he received his undergraduate degree in Mathematics from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in 2014, and in 2015 obtained his M.Sc. degree in Computing from Imperial College London. During the fall of 2018, he was a research intern at Facebook AI Research, Montreal, Canada.
<br>
<br>His research interests include large-scale optimization, machine learning, randomized numerical linear algebra, distributed and decentralized algorithms, game theory, and deep learning. His current research focuses on the theory and applications of convex and non-convex optimization in large-scale machine learning and data science problems. He has received several awards and fellowships, including OR Society's 2019 Doctoral Award (runner-up) for the ''Most Distinguished Body of Research leading to the Award of a Doctorate in the field of Operational Research'' and the IVADO Postdoctoral Fellowship.
